#### Django ORM(Objection Relational Mapper):
- Helps us to access database in a easy to manage way.
- Database Structure is represented as classes often called models
- model.py file is in every app created

#### Creating models
- users model is provided by django
- make migration after creating models 0001init.py file is created. This file has code to run when we enter migrate command
- ``` python manage.py sqlmigrate blog 0001 ``` in cmd shows the actual SQL that runs while running migrate command.
- all by the virtue of ORM. 
- finally, run the migrate command 

#### Working in django shell 

```bash

(correyenv) F:\python\corey-schaffer\django_project>python manage.py shell

# Add dunder method (method such as __str__() to change how the title of the post is displayed)
>>> user = User.objects.filter(username='admin').first()
>>> user
<User: admin>
>>> post = Post.objects.first()
>>> post
<Post: Blog 1> #here instead of post_1, blog 1 is displayed. Courtesy of __str__() method
>>> post.content
'First Post Content!'
>>> post.date_posted

>>> post.author

>>> post.author.email
'admin123@gmail.com'

>>> user.post_set

>>> user.post_set.all()
<QuerySet [<Post: Blog 1>, <Post: Blog 2>, <Post: blog 3>, <Post: Blog 4>]>
>>> user.post_set.create(title = 'Blog 4', content = '5th post content')

#### Registering Models in admin page:
- go to admin.py in your app directory
- Type in the following:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Post

admin.site.register(Post)
```
- Here we have registered the **Post** model to the admin page. Now, all the Post model saved in the database can be accessed in the admin page.
