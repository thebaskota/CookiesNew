###  Login and Logout system

#### In project's urls.py:
- Import login and logout views. These are class based views. 
- They handle logics and forms but not templates.
- In ``` .as_view(template_name='users/login.html') ``` method we provide the location of the template for the login views
- If we only use ``` as_view() ``` then our login and logout will by default operate with admin page. You can login to admin page from the imported login view and the associated template.

```python
from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views

urlpatterns = [
    path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='users/login.html'), name='login'),
    path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(template_name='users/logout.html'), name='logout'),

] 
```
- we created a login.html page in user/templates. We place a url for register.html in login template. We have included ```{{ form|crispy}}``` too
- when we log in django's login view  automatically takes us to /profile url. We can change that from the project's settings.py. Include the following in settings.py:

```python

LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'blog-home'


```
- Now we can redirected to our blog-home (or the home page) when we log in. 
- Changing navbars. (if logged in present logout and profile in navbar, else provide login and register)

**base.html:**

```html

<!-- Navbar Right Side -->
<div class="navbar-nav">
		{% if user.is_authenticated %}
				 <a class="nav-item nav-link" href="{% url 'logout'%}">Logout</a>
				 <a class="nav-item nav-link" href="{% url 'profile'%}">Profile</a>
		{% else %}
				<a class="nav-item nav-link" href="{% url 'login'%}">Login</a>
				<a class="nav-item nav-link" href="{% url 'register'%}">Register</a>
		{% endif %}
</div>

```

#### Adding Profiles:
- create url pattern with user's views. Note that users are django's built-in models which out users app has inherited. And so has it's views. 
- In users views define the views for profile. Declare a @login_required decorator so you can only access profile views when the user has logged in

```python 

@login_required
def profile(request):
...
```

- And then Create profile.html
- Overwriting default login views of django by going to settings.py and adding the following: ``` LOGIN_URL = 'login'```
- 'login' is the name we have given to our url to route the login page. 

### User profile and picture:

- Create a profile model in users app's models.py and extend the users models.
- one to one relationship : One user can have one profile and vice versa.
- models.CASCADE delete profile if user is deleted but not vice versa.
- run migrations
- import pillow to work with imagefield.'
- Register model in admin.py of users app.

```python

from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    image = models.ImageField(default='default.jpg', upload_to='profile_pics')

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.user.username} Profile'

```

- Accessing profiles and images from shell (an example to use it for our app):

```bash

>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
>>> user = User.objects.filter(username='admin').first()
>>> user
<User: admin>
>>> user.profile
<Profile: admin Profile> #Since we used dunder str to return username
>>> user.profile.image #directly access user's profile, pic
<ImageFieldFile: profile_pics/kHK4mjZNH5TTgIZIhtWH_1082092625.jpeg>
>>> user.profile.image.width
750
>>> user.profile.image.url #getting location of the image
'profile_pics/kHK4mjZNH5TTgIZIhtWH_1082092625.jpeg'
>>> user = User.objects.filter(username='supremezod').first()
>>> user
<User: supremezod>
>>> user.profile.image
<ImageFieldFile: default.jpg>
>>> exit()
```
- Define media root and media url in the settings.py. By doing this you can specify the location of picture and other media present in the project to django, It is a convention to put all the files in the media directory.
- In settings.py:

```python

MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media') 
#full path is created to media
# directory no matter which os you are on, because of os.path.join(), BASE_DIR # is the project's base directory of project and from that directory media is next 
# directory which is accessed
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

```

- Wont be applied to already created profile. But only to new profile. So delete old profiles.
- Adding profile details:

```html

<div class="media">
            <img class="rounded-circle account-img" src="{{user.profile.image.url}}">
            <div class="media-body">
                <h2 class="account-heading">{{ user.username }}</h2>
                <p class="text-secondary">{{ user.email }}</p>
            </div>
        </div>

```

- In urls.py of project, to include static files during development phase, you can do the following:

```python

if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

```

- Inside users app directory, we created a signal.py file.
- post_save is imported. This is a signal that expires after a post is saved.
- we want to get post_save signal when a user is created. so we imported users(users is sender)
- reciever recieves signals.
- imported Profile to create profile for each users. Defined create_profile() function
- add @reciever decorator.


```python

from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.dispatch import receiver
from .models import Profile


@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        Profile.objects.create(user=instance)


@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def save_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    instance.profile.save()

```
- go to app.py of users and define ready method:

```python

from django.apps import AppConfig

class UsersConfig(AppConfig):
    name = 'users'

    def ready(self):
        import users.signals

```

### Update user profile, profile picture, profile picture resizing:

- In order to update some users and profiles, we need to create forms. Open users->forms.py
- create ModelForm. ModelForm works with specific database model. We are going to update User model. 

```python

from .models import Profile

class UserUpdateForm(forms.ModelForm):
		#to update user information
    email = forms.EmailField()

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ['username', 'email']

class ProfileUpdateForm(forms.ModelForm):
		#for profile picture update
    class Meta:
        model = Profile
        fields = ['image']

```

- Although it will seem like a single form in the template but here we have created two forms here.
- In views of users app import and add to profile views the forms that we created in forms.py

```python

from .forms import UserUpdateForm, ProfileUpdateForm

@login_required
def profile(request):
    u_form = UserUpdateForm()
    p_form = ProfileUpdateForm()

    context = {
        'u_form': u_form,
        'p_form': p_form
    }
    return render(request, 'users/profile.html', context)

```

- Now add these forms to the templates of the views. 
- go to ```  users->templates->users->profile.html ``` and add the following snippets:
- note the two ``` {{u_form}} and {{p_form}}``` implies the presence of two forms in a single template
- Also note the enctype on the top is a encoding type for our form. It is required to properly send image files.

```html

<form method ="POST" enctype = "multipart/form-data">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <fieldset clas="form-group">
        <legend class="border-bottom mb-4">Profile Info</legend>
        {{ u_form|crispy}}
        {{ p_form|crispy}}
    </fieldset>
    <div class ="form-group">
        <button class="btn btn-outline-info" type="submit">Update</button>
    </div>
</form>

```

- Populating forms with user's credentials. (go to views.py and do the following):

```

u_form = UserUpdateForm(instance=request.user)
p_form = ProfileUpdateForm(instance = request.user.profile)

```

- Fetching post data from template from to variable form at views.py:
- here u_form and p_form are the form variable which is getting the post request and file submitted by Forms.

```python

if request.method == 'POST':
        u_form = UserUpdateForm(request.POST, instance=request.user)
        p_form = ProfileUpdateForm(request.POST, 
                                    request.FILES, 
                                    instance = request.user.profile)

```

- We save from views, if the forms are valid.

```python

if u_form.is_valid() and p_form.is_valid():
            u_form.save()
            p_form.save()
            messages.success(request, f'Your account has been upfated!')
            return redirect('profile')

```

- Resizing an image:

```python

# Override save method of profile model to resize image
def save(self):
    super().save() # to run

    img = Image.open(self.image.path) #import Image from PIL and open the image
    
    # Resizing and saving to 300x300 
    if img.height>300 or img.width >300:
        output_size = (300,300)
        img.thumbnail(output_size)
        img.save(self.image.path)

```
