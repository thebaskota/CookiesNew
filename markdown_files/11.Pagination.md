## Pagination:

- We are going to add posts from .json. We use django shell for the purpose of adding the content of .json files in or database.
- So in django shell, in order to save the .json file as Post objects in our database, we ran the following commands:

```bash

>>> import json
>>> from blog.models import Post
>>> with open('posts.json') as f:
...     post_json = json.load(f)
>>> for post in posts_json:
...     post = Post(title=post['title'], content=post['content'], author_id=post['user_id'])
...     post.save()
>>> exit()
```
- There was an issue while trying this code. It kept on showing foreign key constraint error. It is still unresolved. But the code is what Corey typed in order to load json and save them as an object. Also, first json object seems to have been saved properly but right from the second post we seem to have this issue. So for now in order to have enough post to paginate, I added few posts from the admin section.
- Now we again open the django shell and try to import a paginator object.

```bash

from django.core.paginator import Paginator #import paginator class
>>> posts = ['1','2','3','4','5'] #make dummy posts that we want to paginate
>>> P = Paginator(posts,2) #creating paginator object for posts with 2 posts per page
>>> P.num_pages #num of pages = 3
>>> P.num_pages
3

#Looping around these pages using page_range attribute
>>> for pages in P.page_range:
...     print(pages)
... 
1
2
3
>>> p1 = P.page(1) # Accessing page no 1
>>> p1
<Page 1 of 3>
>>> p1.number #returns page number of page
1
>>> p1.object_list #getting post in page p1
['1', '2']
>>> p1.has_previous() # Checking if there is a previous page
False # for page 1 it has no previous page, so returns false
>>> p1.has_next() # checking if there is a next page
True
>>> p1.next_page_number() # Getting next page number
2
>>> exit()

```
- Now let us open up our views and try these shell codes to paginate our post. We don't have to import paginator class or anything. Just go to our list view (CBV) and add the following line:

```python

paginate_by = 2

```
- This determines how many post must be there in each page. In our case it is 2. 
- Now we have only 2 post in our homepage. But there are not link to go to next pages.
- Still in our url we can type as ``` localhost:8000/?page=3 ``` and our 3rd page will be displayed. If we type ?page=89 or some higher number we'll get 404 error.

- Now we will add links to the pages. Our CBVs already passes the context that we need. So we are going to utilize that. 
- Lets open home.html template, where we are going to be displaying our post.
- In the bottom of the page we need to add 1,2,... next sort of display. So we have added the following code:

```html 

{% if is_paginated %}
    {% if page_obj.has_previous %}
        <a class = "btn btn-outline-info mb-4"href="?page=1">First</a>
        <a class = "btn btn-outline-info mb-4"href="?page={{ page_obj.previous_page_number}}">Previous</a>
    {% endif %}

    {% for num in page_obj.paginator.page_range %}
        {% if page_obj.number == num %}
            <a class = "btn btn-info mb-4" href="?page={{ num }}">{{ num }}</a>
        {% elif num > page_obj.number|add:'-2' and  num < page_obj.number|add:'2'%} 
            <a class = "btn btn-outline-info mb-4" href="?page={{ num }}">{{ num }}</a>
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}

    {% if page_obj.has_next %}
        <a class = "btn btn-outline-info mb-4"href="?page={{ page_obj.next_page_number}}">Next</a>
        <a class = "btn btn-outline-info mb-4"href="?page={{ page_obj.paginator.num_pages}}">Last</a>
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}

```

- check whether the page is paginated.

- if page has previous post give an option to go to prevous page and the very first page
- we used the href of ?page=1 for first page and previous_page_number for Previous page.

- Now, We are going to loop over all of the pages in the paginator in order to present certain number of pages around the page.
    - Suppose we are on page 5, then we'd like to have link to some pages before 5 and some pages after 5.
    - We want to navigate to the pages nearby
- If we are on same page number we want the button to be less outlined.
- Else if the num is with +- 2 of current page number range, put the link to that page number.

- If page has next, put the next and the last link too. note the use of ```"?page={{ page_obj.next_page_number}}" ``` for Next and of ``` "?page={{ page_obj.paginator.num_pages}}" ``` for last page.  

- Once you have more post, which you should in order to use paginator efficiently, you must add more post per page and more +- pages around current page. 

- Making a route to display only the post from that particular user from the link we have on top of the blog post. And paginate the user post too. 
- We are going to make a user post list view in blog's views.py file. 

```python 

class UserPostListView( ListView):
    model = Post
    template_name = 'blog/user_post.html' 
    context_object_name = 'posts_context'
    paginate_by = 2

    def get_queryset(self):
        user = get_object_or_404(User, username=self.kwargs.get('username'))
        return Post.objects.filter(author=user).order_by('-date_posted')


```

- This code still would show all the post if we didn't add the filter to get only the post by certain user.
- User is going to come directly from the URL. When we specify the URL pattern for this we will specify the username and the URL path itself.
- username variable is passed into the url. 
- In order to modify the query set this list view return we can override the ``` get_queryset method(self) ``` method and change the query_set from within there.
- If the recieved username doesn't exist, we can use the ``` user = get_object_or_404(User, username=self.kwargs.get('username'))``` method to address the problem. It return a 404 page if user doesn't exist. And that is better than returning an empty page.
- remember to import ```python from django.shortcuts import  get_object_or_404 ```
- at last we return post with the recieved username as its author. We do that as: ``` return Post.objects.filter(author=user).order_by('-date_posted') ```
- We ordered by date posted, newest post first by adding - sign. 

- So in blog's url first we imported the views that we just created. Then we add the path for our views. 

```python

'''---BLOG->URLS.py---'''

from .views import  UserPostListView

urlpatterns = [
    path('user/<str:username>', UserPostListView.as_view(), name='user-posts')
]
```
- <> angle bracket to handle datatype
- Now create user_post.html template in blog's template.
- We add the pagination logic. Acces the username as ``` {{ view.kwargs.username }} ```
- In order to count how many post there are by the user, we can use the current page object and the paginator object's count attribute. We do it as: ``` {{ page_obj.paginator.count }} ```
- We also added the link to user's post as : 
``` <a class="mr-2" href="{%url 'user-posts' post.author.username %}">{{ post.author }}</a> ```
- We added above code in home and post templates as well. 
- In post detail template we use object instead of post. 
``` <a class="mr-2" href="{%url 'user-posts' object.author.username %}">{{ object.author }}</a> ```

```html

{% extends 'blog/base.html' %}

{% block content %}
<h1 class = "mb-3"> Posts by {{ view.kwargs.username }} ({{ page_obj.paginator.count }})</h1>
    {% for post in posts_context%}
    <article class="media content-section">
        <img class="rounded-circle article-img" src = "{{post.author.profile.image.url}}">
        <div class="media-body">
            <div class="article-metadata">
                <a class="mr-2" href="{%url 'user-posts' post.author.username %}">{{ post.author }}</a>
                <small class="text-muted">{{ post.date_posted|date:"F d, Y" }}</small>
            </div>
            <h2><a class="article-title" href="{%url 'post-detail' post.id %}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
            <p class="article-content">{{ post.content }}</p>
        </div>
    </article>
    {% endfor %}
    {% if is_paginated %}
        {% if page_obj.has_previous %}
            <a class = "btn btn-outline-info mb-4"href="?page=1">First</a>
            <a class = "btn btn-outline-info mb-4"href="?page={{ page_obj.previous_page_number}}">Previous</a>
        {% endif %}

        {% for num in page_obj.paginator.page_range %}
            {% if page_obj.number == num %}
                <a class = "btn btn-info mb-4" href="?page={{ num }}">{{ num }}</a>
            {% elif num > page_obj.number|add:'-2' and  num < page_obj.number|add:'2'%} 
                <a class = "btn btn-outline-info mb-4" href="?page={{ num }}">{{ num }}</a>
            {% endif %}
        {% endfor %}

        {% if page_obj.has_next %}
            <a class = "btn btn-outline-info mb-4"href="?page={{ page_obj.next_page_number}}">Next</a>
            <a class = "btn btn-outline-info mb-4"href="?page={{ page_obj.paginator.num_pages}}">Last</a>
        {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
{% endblock content %}
