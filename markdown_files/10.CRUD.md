## Features:
- User adds posts
- Class based views

#### Class Based Views in blog -> *views.py*

- In function based views we set a views to a url. Then views handled the URL properly, either it rendered a template or carried out some logic.
- Types of Class-based-views: List, Detail, Create, Update, Delete - CBVs
- These are generic views provided by django
- Home page is a good candidate to use list views because it lists our post. 
- so in blog's views.py, we created the following CBVs:

```python

class PostListView(ListView):
    model = Post
    template_name = 'blog/home.html' #<app>/<model>_<viewtype>.html
    context_object_name = 'posts_context'
    ordering = ['-date_posted']

```

- In order to sort our post according to date they are posted we added following line in PostListView() function of blog->views:

```python
    ordering = ['-date_posted'] # -date_posted => newest to oldest, no - sign => oldest to newest

```

- In CBVs we didn't need any return or render. 
- If we had named the template and its directory according to default convention, then our CBV would require only model name and also ordering.
- Let us define another generic CBVs. These are DetailView.
- first let us define the class in views.py as:

```python

    class PostDetailView(DetailView):
        model = Post

```

- Then let us define the default url convention for DetailView as:

```python

    path('post/<int:pk>/', PostDetailView.as_view(), name='post-detail'),

```

- Now let us create a file named post_detail.html according to our convention : <app>/<model>_<viewtype>.html
- ``` localhost:8000/post/2 ``` will display a post_detail.html file present in app(blog in our case)->model(post)_viewtype(detail).html file

### Creatingg New Post:

- We'll need CreateView.
- In views.py import ``` CreateView ```
- Create the CBV as follows:

```python
    class PostCreateView(CreateView):
        model = Post
        fields = ['title', 'content']

```
- We'll need to provide things that will be in our forms in create view. Which we have done in fields. 
- We'll also need to register in urls.py as:

```python

from .views import PostCreateView

urlpatterns = [
    path('post/new', PostCreateView.as_view(), name='post-create'),
]

```
- Template covention for CreateView is going to match with the UpdateView. <modelname>_form. In our instance, post_form.html

- In PostCreateView:

```python

# Overriding form_valid method to pass our logged in author as the author of the blog.
# If we dont do this we will get an integrity error saying author is not passed
    def form_valid(self, form):
        form.instance.author = self.request.user #current logged in user is passed as author
        return super().form_valid(form) #running parent's form_valid method

```

- Even for class based views we need to specify the path to redirect to. We use reverse function to redirect to a URL after submitting a post. We do that as by using get_absolute_urls() function and a reverse function. 

```python
'''----models.py->Post------'''

    #We use reverse function to get the URL to a particular route, and not redirect function
    # redirect returned the page but reverse return the string of URL and views handles the rest
    # We need to use getabsoluteUrl method for django to find a location to a specific post
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse("post-detail", kwargs={"pk": self.pk})
    
    #Here we are redirecting to the detail page, i.e. post detail page handled by detail view.

```
- These would've taken us lot of work if we had worked with the function based views.
- Here the author are assigned as the user who is logged in. So, we must not be able to add post if the user is not logged in. We did something similar before by using a decorator @login_required. But we cannot use decorator in classes. But we are going to use login-mixin class. We are going to inherit from that adds login functionality to a view.

```python

from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin

class PostListView(LoginRequiredMixin, ListView):
    ...

```

- Now, we cannot create without logging in
- Now let us create an update view.

```python
'''--------------views-------------------------'''
from django.views.generic import UpdateView

class PostUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin, UpdateView):
    model = Post
    fields = ['title', 'content']

    def form_valid(self, form):
        form.instance.author = self.request.user
        return super().form_valid(form) 

'''--------------urls--------------------------'''

from .views import PostUpdateView

urlpatterns = [
    path('post/<int:pk>/update/', PostUpdateView.as_view(), name='post-update'),
]
```

- Now we'd like to add the feature that allows only the author of the post to update the post. We can do this adding another mixins. First we import the UserPassesTestMixin, Inherit it from the PostUpdateView and create a method named testfunc(). This is a method that test whether the user passes certain condition.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import UserPassesTestMixin
...

class PostUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin, UserPassesTestMixin, UpdateView):
    ...
    def test_func(self):
        post = self.get_object()
        if self.request.user == post.author: # Checking if current user is author of the post
            return True
        return False
    
    '''
        - How is this view Routing to post-detail ?
    '''

```

- Now if you are logged in as admin and try to update testuser post, you will get 403 forbidden message

- Now we are going to add the delete view. Similar to detail view. Import the delete view. Add CBV. We require user to be the author of the post. So we require logged user and the user should be author of the post. We do this by using two mixins: LoginRequiredMixin, UserPassesTestMixin and also add the test_func(). And finally include the route in urls.py.

```python

'''-------VIEWS.py-------'''
from django.views.generic import DeleteView

from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin, UserPassesTestMixin

class PostDeleteView(LoginRequiredMixin, UserPassesTestMixin, DeleteView):
    model = Post
    def test_func(self):
        post = self.get_object()
        if self.request.user == post.author: # Checking if current user is author of the post
            return True
        return False

'''-------URLS.py------'''
from .views import PostDeleteView

urlpatterns = [
    path('post/<int:pk>/delete/', PostDeleteView.as_view(), name='post-delete'),
]
```

- Delete view expects a template. A template with a form that asks whether you want to delete. If you submit that form the post will be deleted. This template is going to be called post_confirm_delete.html
- In post_confirm_delete.html we created a submit button to submit a form. When this form is submitted, the post is automatically deleted. **How does this work?**

```html

{% extends 'blog/base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    <div class="content-section">
        <form method ="POST">
            {% csrf_token %}
            <fieldset clas="form-group">
                <legend class="border-bottom mb-4">Delete Post</legend>
                <h2> Are you sure you want to delete the post "{{object.title}}"
            </fieldset>
            <div class ="form-group">
                <button class="btn btn-outline-danger" type="submit">Yes, Delete</button>
                <a class="btn btn-outline-secondary" href="{% url 'post-detail' object.id%}">Cancel</a>
            </div>
        </form>
    </div>
{% endblock content %}


```
- still we need to specify the succcess url page. Since the post cannot go to its original post we need to specify the success URL. Home page is a good candidate for our success URL after the home page.

```python

class PostDeleteView(LoginRequiredMixin, UserPassesTestMixin, DeleteView):
    model = Post

    success_url = '/'
    
    ...

```

- We have added these features. But we have been accessing them from url link. by typing ``` localhost:8000/post/2/delete ``` or something similar
- We are going to add link to new post, buttons to delete and update users if the user is logged in and is the author is the blog. 

```html
<!-- BASE.html -->
{% if user.is_authenticated %}
    <a class="nav-item nav-link" href="{% url 'post-create'%}">New Post</a>

<!-- POST_DETAIL.html -->
{% if object.author == user %}
    <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm mt-1 mb-1" href= "{% url 'post-update' object.id %}">Update</a>
    <a class="btn btn-danger btn-sm mt-1 mb-1" href= "{% url 'post-delete' object.id %}">Delete</a>
{% endif %}
```
- We have included update and delete url in the anchor element. We have also checked whether the logged user is author of the post. We are only displaying new post option if the user is authenticated.
